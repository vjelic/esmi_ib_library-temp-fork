One such function is `printf`.\n\nThe `printf` function is a common function in C programming for output formatting. However, it can lead to vulnerabilities if not used correctly. For instance, if user-supplied data is passed directly to `printf` as the format string, it can lead to a format string vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to read or write to arbitrary memory, leading to information disclosure or code execution.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `printf` and similar functions with variable format strings. Instead, use safer alternatives that do not allow for format string vulnerabilities, such as `puts` or `fputs` for simple string output. If formatted output is necessary, ensure that the format string is a constant and not user-supplied data.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nprintf(user_supplied_string);\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nputs(user_supplied_string);\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nfputs(user_supplied_string, stdout);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code examples above require the C standard library, which is typically included with `#include <stdio.h>`.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)"

If formatted output is necessary, ensure that the format string is a constant and not user-supplied data.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nprintf(user_supplied_string);\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nputs(user_supplied_string);\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nfputs(user_supplied_string, stdout);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code examples above require the C standard library, which is typically included with `#include <stdio.h>`.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)"

The `memcpy` function is used to copy a block of memory from one location to another. However, if not used carefully, it can lead to buffer overflows, which occur when data is written beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer. This can result in undefined behavior, including data corruption, crashes, and security vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the `memcpy` function is used as follows:\n\n```cpp\nmemcpy(features + offset, feat_ver5_F1A_M00_1F_set, (ARRAY_SIZE(feat_ver5_F1A_M00_1F_set));\n```\n\nThe vulnerability arises if the destination buffer (`features + offset`) is not large enough to accommodate the data being copied from `feat_ver5_F1A_M00_1F_set`. This can lead to a buffer overflow.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Bounds Checking**: Always ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. This can be done by performing explicit bounds checking before calling `memcpy`.\n\n2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Consider using safer alternatives like `memmove` or `std::copy` (in C++) which provide better safety guarantees.\n\n3. **Static Analysis Tools**: Use static analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows in your code.\n\n4. **Code Reviews**: Regularly perform code reviews to catch potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo fix the specific vulnerability, ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied.

The specific issue is related to the potential for buffer overflow, which occurs when the destination buffer is not large enough to accommodate the data being copied. This can lead to undefined behavior, including data corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution.\n\nIn the provided code snippet:\n\n```cpp\nmemcpy(features + offset, feat_ver6_set, (ARRAY_SIZE(feat_ver6_set)));\n```\n\nThe vulnerability may occur if the size of `features` from `offset` onward is smaller than `ARRAY_SIZE(feat_ver6_set)`. This can result in writing beyond the bounds of the `features` array.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Bounds Checking**: Always ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. Perform explicit bounds checking before calling `memcpy`.\n\n2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Consider using safer alternatives like `memmove` or `std::copy` (in C++) which provide better safety guarantees.\n\n3. **Static Analysis Tools**: Use static analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows during development.\n\n4. **Code Reviews**: Regularly conduct code reviews to catch potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability, ensure that the destination buffer has enough space to accommodate the data being copied.

The specific issue is with the line:\n\n```cpp\nmemcpy(features + offset, feat_ver3, (ARRAY_SIZE(feat_ver3))\n```\n\nThis line attempts to copy data from `feat_ver3` to `features` starting at a given `offset`. The problem is that if the destination buffer `features` is not large enough to accommodate the data being copied, it can result in a buffer overflow, leading to undefined behavior, potential data corruption, or security vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Bounds Checking**: Always ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the data being copied. This can be done by checking the size of the destination buffer against the size of the data being copied.\n\n2. **Use Safer Functions**: Consider using safer alternatives like `memmove` or `std::copy` in C++ which provide better safety guarantees.\n\n3. **Static Analysis Tools**: Use static analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities in your code.\n\n4. **Code Reviews**: Regular code reviews can help catch potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo fix the specific vulnerability, ensure that the size of the destination buffer is checked before performing the copy operation.

The specific issue arises when the size of the data being copied is not properly calculated or checked, leading to potential buffer overflows. This can result in undefined behavior, including data corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities such as arbitrary code execution.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the vulnerability is due to the incorrect calculation of the size parameter in the `memcpy` function:\n\n```cpp\nmemcpy(features + offset, feat_ver2_get, (ARRAY_SIZE(feat_ver2_get))\n```\n\nThe `ARRAY_SIZE` macro or function is likely intended to calculate the size of the `feat_ver2_get` array.

                "markdown": "### Description\n\nThe \"Detection of Prohibited C Function\" vulnerability in C++ programming arises when certain C standard library functions, known for their lack of safety, are used. These functions can lead to security issues such as buffer overflows, data corruption, and undefined behavior. The `asctime` function is one such function that is considered unsafe because it returns a pointer to a static buffer that can be overwritten by subsequent calls, leading to potential data races and buffer overflows.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with using `asctime`, it is recommended to use safer alternatives that provide better control over buffer sizes and avoid the use of static buffers. In the case of `asctime`, the `strftime` function is a safer alternative as it allows specifying the size of the output buffer, thus preventing buffer overflows.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to replace the use of `asctime` with `strftime`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <iomanip>\n\nint main() {\n    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);\n    std::tm* tm_ptr = std::localtime(&t);\n\n    // Buffer to store the formatted date and time\n    char buffer[100];\n\n    // Use strftime instead of asctime\n    if (std::strftime(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%c\", tm_ptr)) {\n        std::cout << \"Current date and time: \" << buffer << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to format date and time.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nTo execute the above code example, the following standard libraries are required:\n\n- `<iostream>`: For input and output stream operations.\n- `<ctime>`: For time manipulation functions.\n- `<iomanip>`: For input/output manipulators (optional, but often used for formatting).\n\n### Relevant Resources\n\n- [OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)\n- [Common Weakness Enumeration - CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)"

These functions are often prohibited in secure coding standards.\n\nThe `localtime` function is one of these prohibited functions. It converts a time_t value to a tm structure as local time. The problem with `localtime` is that it is not thread-safe. It returns a pointer to a static internal object, and subsequent calls to `localtime` will modify the same object.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use thread-safe alternatives to `localtime` such as `localtime_r` in POSIX compliant systems or `localtime_s` in Windows.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the `localtime` function with its thread-safe alternative. Here is an example:\n\n```cpp\n#include <ctime>\n\n// Old vulnerable code\nstd::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);\nstd::tm* unsafe = std::localtime(&t);\n\n// Recommended secure code\nstd::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);\nstd::tm safe;\nlocaltime_r(&t, &safe);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the `<ctime>` library.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)"

The vulnerability arises when the string `str` is not null-terminated, which can lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, and other unexpected behaviors. This is because `strlen(str)` counts characters until it encounters a null character (`\\0`), and if it doesn't find one, it could continue reading and returning data from memory beyond the intended boundary of the string.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, always ensure that your strings are null-terminated. This can be done by initializing your strings with a null character at the end, or by manually adding a null character at the end of your strings after they have been modified.\n\nAlso, consider using safer alternatives to `strlen(str)`, such as `strnlen(str, max_len)`, which takes a maximum length parameter and will not read beyond this limit, even if it doesn't encounter a null character.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstring>\n\nchar str[] = \"Hello, World!\";\nsize_t len = strlen(str);\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstring>\n\nchar str[] = \"Hello, World!\";\nsize_t max_len = sizeof(str) / sizeof(str[0]) - 1;\nsize_t len = strnlen(str, max_len);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe `strlen` and `strnlen` functions are part of the `<cstring>` library in C++.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_v2.pdf)"

If `strlen` is called on a string that is not properly null-terminated, it can lead to undefined behavior, including reading beyond the buffer's bounds, which can cause crashes or expose sensitive data. This is a common issue in C/C++ programming due to manual memory management and lack of built-in bounds checking.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Null-Termination**: Always ensure that strings are null-terminated before passing them to `strlen`.\n2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Consider using safer string handling functions or libraries that automatically manage string lengths and null-termination, such as `std::string` in C++.\n3. **Bounds Checking**: Implement bounds checking to ensure that operations on strings do not exceed their allocated memory.\n4. **Static Analysis Tools**: Use static analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities in your code.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nBelow is an example of how to safely use `strlen` by ensuring the string is null-terminated:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring> // Required for strlen\n\nint main() {\n    const size_t max_size = 100;\n    char max_str[max_size];\n\n    // Ensure the string is null-terminated\n    strncpy(max_str, \"Example string\", max_size - 1);\n    max_str[max_size - 1] = '\\0'; // Explicitly null-terminate\n\n    // Safe usage of strlen\n    size_t length = strlen(max_str);\n    std::cout << \"Length of the string is: \" << length << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nTo execute the above code example, the following standard libraries are required:\n\n- `<iostream>`: For input and output stream operations.\n- `<cstring>`: For C-style string handling functions like `strlen` and `strncpy`.\n\n### Relevant Resources\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration\n\n- [CWE-170: Improper Null Termination](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/170.html)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"

If formatted output is necessary, ensure that the format string is a constant and not user-supplied data.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nprintf(user_supplied_string);\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nputs(user_supplied_string);\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```cpp\nchar* user_supplied_string;\n// ...\nfputs(user_supplied_string, stdout);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code examples above require the C standard library, which is typically included with `#include <stdio.h>`.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)"

This function does not perform bounds checking on the destination buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a program crash, or corrupt data.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Replace `strcpy` with safer alternatives like `strncpy`, `strlcpy`, or C++ string handling functions that perform bounds checking.\n2. **Input Validation**: Always validate input data to ensure it does not exceed buffer sizes.\n3. **Buffer Size Management**: Ensure that destination buffers are adequately sized to handle the maximum expected input size plus a null terminator.\n4. **Static Analysis Tools**: Use static analysis tools to detect and mitigate buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the codebase.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the vulnerable `strcpy` usage with `strncpy` to prevent buffer overflow:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstring> // Required for strncpy\n\n// Assuming hwmon_name is a character array with a known size\nconst size_t hwmon_name_size = sizeof(hwmon_name);\n\n// Use strncpy to copy the string safely\nstrncpy(hwmon_name, pdentry->d_name, hwmon_name_size - 1);\n\n// Ensure null termination\nhwmon_name[hwmon_name_size - 1] = '\\0';\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nTo execute the code example properly, the following library dependency is required:\n\n- `<cstring>`: This header is required for using `strncpy`.\n\n### Relevant Resources\n\n- [OWASP Buffer Overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"

This can lead to buffer overflows, undefined behavior, or access violations, as `strlen` will continue reading memory until it encounters a null character. This is a common issue when dealing with user input or dynamically allocated memory.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Always validate input to ensure it is null-terminated before passing it to `strlen`.\n2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Consider using safer alternatives like `strnlen` which allows specifying a maximum length to prevent reading beyond the buffer.\n3. **Memory Management**: Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation, and initialize buffers to zero to prevent reading uninitialized memory.\n4. **Bounds Checking**: Implement bounds checking to ensure that operations do not exceed buffer limits.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstring> // Required for strlen\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid safe_strlen(const char* cmp_str, size_t max_length) {\n    if (cmp_str == nullptr) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error: Null pointer received.\" << std::endl;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    size_t length = strnlen(cmp_str, max_length);\n    if (length == max_length) {\n        std::cerr << \"Warning: String may not be null-terminated within the specified bounds.\" << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"String length is: \" << length << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    const char* test_str = \"Hello, World!\";\n    safe_strlen(test_str, 100); // Example usage with a maximum length\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\n- `<cstring>`: Required for `strlen` and `strnlen`.\n- `<iostream>`: Required for input/output operations.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)\n- [CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html)"

It can cause format string vulnerabilities if the format string is not a constant, or if it's a string that can be controlled by an attacker. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or information leaks.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid using `fprintf` and other similar functions that do not perform bounds checking. Instead, use safer alternatives that do perform bounds checking, such as `snprintf`. Always ensure that format strings are constants and cannot be controlled by an attacker.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace `fprintf` with `snprintf` as shown below:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstdio>\n\n// Old vulnerable code\nvoid vulnerable_code(FILE* file, const char* data) {\n    fprintf(file, data);\n}\n\n// New secure code\nvoid secure_code(FILE* file, const char* data) {\n    char buffer[1024];\n    snprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), \"%s\", data);\n    fputs(buffer, file);\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library to execute properly:\n\n- `<cstdio>`\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP C++ Secure Coding Practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html)"

One such function is `fscanf`, which can lead to buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other security issues if not used carefully. This vulnerability occurs when `fscanf` is used without proper input validation and bounds checking, allowing an attacker to manipulate input data to exploit the program.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Always validate input data before processing it. Ensure that the input conforms to expected formats and ranges.\n2. **Use Safer Alternatives**: Consider using safer alternatives like `fgets` followed by `sscanf`, which allows for better control over input size and format.\n3. **Bounds Checking**: Implement bounds checking to ensure that input data does not exceed buffer sizes.\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected input or errors during input processing.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nBelow is an example of how to replace `fscanf` with a safer alternative:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cstdio>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    FILE *file = fopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\");\n    if (file == nullptr) {\n        std::cerr << \"Error opening file\" << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    char buffer[100];\n    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != nullptr) {\n        int value;\n        if (sscanf(buffer, \"%d\", &value) == 1) {\n            std::cout << \"Read value: \" << value << std::endl;\n        } else {\n            std::cerr << \"Error reading integer from buffer\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    } else {\n        std::cerr << \"Error reading from file\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    fclose(file);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nTo execute the above code example, the following standard libraries are required:\n\n- `<cstdio>`: For file operations and standard input/output functions.\n- `<cstring>`: For string manipulation functions.\n- `<iostream>`: For input and output stream operations.\n\n### Relevant Resources\n\n- [OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)\n- [Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-676): Use of Potentially Dangerous Function](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)\n\nThese links were verified to be active and accessible to anonymous users."
